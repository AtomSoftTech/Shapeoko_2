### Let's keep a few things in mind:
1. If you unplug a stepper motor from the controller while it's energized (plugged in), you may very well blow up your controller. 
2. Being shocked by electricity is no fun.
3. Being burned by electricity is no fun either.
4. Smart people, who value their eyesight, always wear safetly glasses.
5. If you are unsure of what you're doing. Stop doing it. Ask on the forum before ruining your setup.
6. Have fun. It is, after all, what it's all about.
