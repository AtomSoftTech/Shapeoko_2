Before we get all crazy bolting our new machine together, let's give our electronics a test run. It's frustrating to have the machine fully assembled, only to find there is a problem with your electronics that may require dissassembly! Let's cut that off at the pass and give everythign a thorough checking first.

## Requirements
* Arduino with grbl firmware
* grblShield
* Stepper motors x 4pcs
* Power Supply with wall plug
* Barrell Connector
* Small screwdriver
* Computer with UGS installed
* USB Cable (A to B)
* Patience (just a little bit)
* Testing from github online editor			

##Connect Arduino
Now that we have everything gathered up, you should find yourself with a setup similar to this:

First thing that we do is plug our arduino into the computer.

Remember, the big end of the cable goes into the arduino. 

Chances are, the arduino will be recognized by your computer. If not, [click here](troubleshooting.html) for help.
