## Overview
![exploded view of assembly step](http://placehold.it/200x200)  ![image of completed assembly step](http://placehold.it/200x200) ![exploded view of assembly step](http://placehold.it/200x200) ![video?](http://placehold.it/200x200)

This step is the bulk of the work required to assemble your machine. There are two different styles of plates that we will be assembling in this step. The first style includes a stepper motor, there are 3 of these plates total. and they will be used to drive both your X and Y axis. The other style is nearly identicle to the first, with the exception of not having a stepper motor or smooth idlers attached. This plate will be used to connect your z-axis assembly to your x-axis assembly. 

The 3 plates with stepper motors are identicle and interchangeable. The plates are symetrical, so there is no such thing as a front and a back (as they're the same). Keep in mind that your stepper motor will go on the opposite side of your wheels and smooth idlers.

##Requirements
1. Delrin V-Wheels x 20pcs
1. 5x16x5mm Bearings x 52pcs
1. Precision Spacers x 26pcs
1. Smooth Idlers Drums x 6pcs
1. M5 x 30mm Button Head Cap Screws x 6pcs
1. M5 Hex Nuts x 15pcs
1. M5 Flat Washers x ??pcs
1. M5 x 20mm Button Head Cap Screws x 10pcs
1. M5 x 25mm Button Head Cap Screws x 10pcs
1. 5/16" (or 8mm) End Wrench
1. M5 Hex Key
1. Thread Locking Compount (optional)

##V-Wheels
![assembled v-wheel](http://placehold.it/400x400)
###Assemble all of the v-wheel (20 wheels total)
1. Take one ball bearing, and insert it into the delrin v-wheel
2. Using one of the M5 x 20mm SHCS, slide the wheel over the screw
3. Slide a single precision washer around the screw
4. Slide another bearing around the screw
5. Using your thumbs, squeeze the assembly together. There will be a bit of friction getting the bearings settled into the wheel. When you tighten the wheel to the plate, you will squeeze the entire thing together tightly.
6. Repeat this proceedure for the remaining v-wheels (20 total)

##Smooth Idlers
![assembled idler](http://placehold.it/400x400)
###Assemble all of the smooth idlers (6 idlers total)
1. Take one ball bearing, and insert it into the open end of the smooth idler
2. using one of the m5 x 30mm SHCS, slide the idler over the screw
3. Slide a single precision washer around the screw
4. Slide another bearing around the screw
5. Using your thumbs, squeeze the assembly together. A small portion of the second bearing will be protruding from the edge of the smooth idler. This is normal. We will tighten the entire assembly when the idlers gets bolted to the motor mount plate
6. Repeat this proceedure for the remaining smooth idlers (6 total)


##With Motor
These are the plates that will mount on either end of the gantry and on the rear of the X-Axis.
1. Connect v-wheels to plate
	- two static at the top
	- two eccentric at the bottom
2. Connect the smooth idlers to plate
	- two total
	- take note of the orientation of the bolt
	- take note of the orientation of the bearings/idler
3. Attach your stepper motor
	- Using 4 x M3x6mm SHCS, attach the stepper motor
	- Use an M3 washer between the SHCS and the plate


##Without Motor
This is the plate the z-axis will attach to. It sits on the front of the gantry and will be connected to the x-axis motor mount plate via rigid aluminum spacers. We will build the plate first, and then attach the two together.
1. Connect v-wheels to plate
	- two static at the top
	- two eccentric at the bottom
