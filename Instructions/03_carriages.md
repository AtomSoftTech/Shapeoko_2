## Overview
![exploded view of Motor Mount Carriages](tPictures/PS20022_2.png)  ![image of completed assembly step](http://placehold.it/200x200) ![exploded view of assembly step](http://placehold.it/200x200) ![video?](http://placehold.it/200x200)

This step is the bulk of the work required to assemble your machine. There are two different styles of plates that we will be assembling in this step. The first style includes a stepper motor, there are 3 of these plates total, and they will be used to drive both your X and Y axis. The other style is nearly identical to the first, with the exception of not having a stepper motor or smooth idlers attached. This plate will be used to connect your Z-axis assembly to your X-axis assembly. 

The 3 plates with stepper motors are identical and interchangeable. The plates are symmetrical, so there is no such thing as a front and a back (as they're the same). Keep in mind that your stepper motor will go on the opposite side of your wheels and smooth idlers.
