##A Note on Tapping

There is one fabrication-like step which may be necessary, tapping the MakerSlide. If your MakerSlide is not already tapped, and you do not have experience tapping it, it is suggested that you begin as soon as practicable. Do not however, attempt to tap all of the threads in a single session, instead, tap one or two threads, then proceed to the next step in the process. After completing on eor two steps, return to tapping. Doing it in this fashion will avoid the tedium of a lengthy session.

Start w/ the short length which is used for the Z-axis Carriage (it only needs to be tapped at one end, so a failure to tap two good threads at one end will not render it unusable. Tap one thread at either end, then tap one thread in each of the remaining pieces of MakerSlide, then return to the first piece and start over, tapping a single thread in each piece each time.
