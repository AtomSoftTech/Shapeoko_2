Goal: ShapeOko's goal is to design and build a fully open source (open hardware) 3 axis CNC machine that anyone can build for about $300. We're doing everything possible to design an easy to assembly, fully capable machine that will do it's part in both the open hardware and desktop manufacturing movements.
